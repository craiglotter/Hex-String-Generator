Hex-String-Generator
====================

Hex String Generator is a quick and dirty application that generates a Hex string based on a random generated plaintext string. Hex strings of 10 and 26 characters long can be generated. There is also an option that allows for user specified plaintext string length, meaning almost any length Hex string can in fact be generated.  Created by Craig Lotter, August 2006
